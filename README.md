# KCare-Migration-Data
Writing a Python script that can automatically populate the existing data tables for migrations. Functionality is being written for input from Excel right now with the hope that we can add the ability to input directly from Migration Runner Tool soon.

Note: Elks data is being used for testing - Migration Data and Migration Script are the only truly necessary files.
